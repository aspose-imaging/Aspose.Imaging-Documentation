## **Get Last Modified Date of A Raster Image**
This article demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET to get last modified date of an image. Aspose.Imaging APIs have exposed efficient & easy to use methods to achieve this goal.

### **Get Last Modified Date**
Aspose.Imaging for Python via .NET has exposed the **get_modify_date** method of **Image** class to get the last modified date of an image from its metadata. **get_modify_date** method needs a Boolean value to get the modified date accordingly. The steps to get last modified date are as simple as below:

1. Load an image using the factory method Load exposed by Image class.
1. Convert the image into **RasterImage**.
1. Call the RasterImage.get_modify_date method by passing a Boolean true or false value.

The following code snippet shows you how to get last modified date of the image.

## **Crop WMF Image**
Image cropping usually refers to the removal of the outer parts of an image to help improve the framing. Cropping may also be used for to cut out some portion of an image to increase the focus on a particular area. The **WmfImage** class provides **crop** method that accepts an instance of the **Rectangle** class.Â You can cut out any portion of an image by providing the desired boundaries to the **Rectangle** object.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to Crop any image by Rectangle.
