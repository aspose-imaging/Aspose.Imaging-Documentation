## **Drawing Lines**
This example uses [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class to draw the line shapes on the Image surface. To demonstrate the operation, the example creates a new [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/image) in BMP format and draws lines on the Image surface using [draw_line](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) method exposed by [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class. First, we will create an instance of FileSteram and then we will create an object of the BmpOptions class from aspose.imaging.imageoptions namespace and set its various properties. The most important property is the source property, the source property actually determines where the image data will reside (in the file or stream) and in this case it is a stream. After setting these properties, pass this object to the static *create* method of the [Image](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/image) class along with height and width parameters.

Once the image has been created, we will use the [clear](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics/) method exposed by the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class to set its background color. The [draw_line](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics/) method of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class is used to draw a line on an image connecting two point structures. This method has several overloads accepting the instance of [Pen](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pen) class and coordinates pairs of points or Point/PointF structures as arguments. The [Pen](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pen) Class defines an object used to draw lines, curves and figures. The Pen class has several overloaded constructors to draw lines with specified color, width & brush. The SolidBrush class is used for drawing continuously with specific color. The following code snippet shows you how to draw the line shapes on the Image surface.

After setting these properties, pass this object to the static **create** method of the Image class along with height and width arguments.

After creating image, we will create and initialize [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class object and set image background color using the [Clear](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/clear) method of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class. The [DrawEllipse](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics/methods/drawellipse/index) method of the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class is used to draw ellipse shape on an image surface specified by the bounding rectangle structure. This method has several overloads accepting the instances of the [Pen](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pen) and [Rectangle](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/rectangle)/[RectangleF](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/rectanglef) classes or a pair of coordinates, a height, and a width as arguments. The [Pen](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pen) class defines an object used to draw lines, curves and figures. The [Pen](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/pen) class has several overloaded constructors to draw lines with specified color, width & brush. The [Rectangle](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/rectangle) class stores a set of four integers that represent the location and size of a rectangle. The Rectangle class has several overloaded constructors to draw the rectangle structure with specified size and location. The SolidBrush class is used for drawing continuously with specific color. The following code snippet shows you how to draw ellipse shape on the Image surface.

We will use [draw_arc](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics/#methods) method of [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) to demonstrate the operation on a BMP image. First, we will create an object of the BMPOptions class from aspose.imaging.imageoptions namespace and set its various properties. The most important property is the Source property. This property actually determines where the image data will reside (in the file or stream) and in this case it is a stream. After setting these properties, pass this object to the static **create** method of the Image class to create a new BMP image. Once the image has been created, we will use the [clear](https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics/#methods) method exposed by the [Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/search/python-net/aspose.imaging/graphics) class to set its background color.

## **Drawing Images using Core Functionality**
Aspose.Imaging is an imaging library that offers many valuable features including creating images from scratch. Draw using the core functionality like manipulating an image's bitmap information, or use the advanced features like Graphics and GraphicsPath to draw shapes on image surface with the help of different brushes and pens. Using Aspose.Imaging's [RasterImage]() class, you can retrieve an image area's pixel information manipulate it. The RasterImage class contains the entire core drawing functionality, like getting and setting pixels and other methods for image manipulation. Create a new image using any of the methods described in [Creating Files]() and assign it to an instance of the RasterImage class. Use the RasterImage class' load_pixels method to retrieve the pixel information of a portion of an image. Once you have an array of pixels, you can manipulate it by, for example, changing the color of each pixel. After manipulating the pixel information, set it back to the desired area in the image using the RasterImage class' save_pixels method. The following code snippet shows you how to draw images using core functionality.
