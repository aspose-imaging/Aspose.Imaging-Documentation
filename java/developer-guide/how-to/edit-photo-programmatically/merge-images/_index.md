## How to merge images

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 You need to calculate the total size of the resulting image before merging. You can merge images in the horizontal or vertical direction. Depending on the merge direction, you will need to sum the total width or total height of the new images. Then create a new merge image with the calculated dimensions and put the images into the new one.
