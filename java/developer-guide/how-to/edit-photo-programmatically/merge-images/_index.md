## How to merge images

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Merging images can be in the horizontal or vertical direction and it is possible to save the combing image onto different formats. Before merging images we need to calculate the total size of the resulting image by summing the total width or height of the images depending on the merge direction. Then we create a new merge image with the calculated dimensions and combine our images into one.
