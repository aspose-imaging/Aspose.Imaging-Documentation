Aspose.Imaging is a flexible and easy to use API. This article shows, step by step, how to set up and write your very first Java application with Aspose.Imaging.

All Aspose components, when installed, work in [evaluation mode](/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=imagingjava&title=Evaluation+Version+Limitations_Imaging&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=15302955). The evaluation mode has no time limit and it injects watermarks into the produced Images.
