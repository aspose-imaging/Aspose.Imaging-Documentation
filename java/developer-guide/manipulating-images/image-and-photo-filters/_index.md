&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Increasing awareness and, consequently, web page traffic is the goal of any website owner. One effective method to attract users is by utilizing the alpha blending image filter to apply watermarks using an overlay image. Distributing images with your brand name across the internet not only increases your recognition but also safeguards the image's quality. This blend image filter serves as both advertisement and protection against image theft.

However, this isn't the only reason to include alpha blending image effect in your arsenal of image manipulation tools. Using this image filter presents an excellent opportunity to introduce creativity into your work. For instance, you can achieve transparency effects by layering images with different opacity levels, transforming an ordinary portrait into a unique collage-like creation, and much more.
