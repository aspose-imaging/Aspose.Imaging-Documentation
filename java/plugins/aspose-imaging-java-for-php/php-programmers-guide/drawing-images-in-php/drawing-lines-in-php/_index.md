$create_options->setBitsPerPixel(32);

\# Define the source property for the instance of BmpOptions

$ary=array();

$create_options->setSource(new StreamSource(new ByteArrayInputStream($ary)));

\# Create an instance of Image

$image=new Image();

$image = $image->create($create_options,100,100);

\# Create an instance of Color

$color = new Color();

\# Create an instance of Pen

$pen = new Pen();

\# Create and initialize an instance of Graphics class

$graphic = new Graphics($image);

\# Clear the image surface with Yellow color

$graphic->clear($color->getYellow());

\# Draw a dotted line by specifying the Pen object having blue color and co-ordinate Points

$graphic->drawLine(new Pen($color->getBlue()), 9, 9, 90, 90);

$graphic->drawLine(new Pen($color->getBlue()), 9, 90, 90, 9);

$solid_brush = new SolidBrush();

$point = new Point();
