Utilize the Image Compressor license plugin to efficiently reduce the size of your images across various <a href="/imaging/java/supported-file-formats/">supported formats</a>. Begin by obtaining a Metered license through the `setMeteredKey()` method, applying your public and private keys. Compression methods differ depending on the image format. Below are Java code examples tailored for common image formats such as APNG, BMP, DICOM, JPEG or SVG. Regardless of whether you're compressing raster or vector images, you have numerous options available. For example, in the JPEG format, you can adjust compression settings using <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions/jpegoptions/">JpegOptions()</a>, setting the Quality parameter to 75%.
