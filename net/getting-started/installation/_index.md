## **Considerations When Running on a Shared Server Environment**
All Aspose .NET components are recommended to run with Full Trust permission set. This is because Aspose .NET component sometimes need to access registry settings and files located in places other than the virtual directory e.g. for reading fonts etc. Furthermore, Aspose.NET components are based on core .NET system classes, some of which also require Full Trust permission to run in some cases.

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such a security level may set the following constraints which could affect the ability of Aspose.Words to perform properly.

- **RegistryPermission** is not available. This means you cannot access the registry, which is required to enumerate installed fonts when rendering documents.
- **FileIOPermission** is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application’s virtual directory hierarchy. This potentially means fonts cannot be read during export.

For these reasons specified above, it is recommended that Aspose.Imaging to run on Full Trust permissions. You may find that some features of library will work when performing different tasks in Medium trust while some won't (rendering for example) which may due to calls to GDI+ image processing.
## **Working with .NET Core DLLs in Non-Windows Environment**
As Aspose.Imaging for .NET provides .NET Standard 2.0 (.NET Core 2.0, .NET Core 3.1 and .NET5) support, so it can be used in Core Applications running in Linux like operating systems. We are constantly working over improving the .NET Core support in our API. However, there are some following operations which we recommend our customers to perform, in order to get better results while using features of Aspose.Imaging for .NET:

Please install:

1. libgdiplus package
1. libc6-dev package
1. package with Microsoft compatible fonts: ttf-mscorefonts-installer. (e.g. *sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer*)
## **Working with .NET Core DLLs installed via MSI package**
**Please note:** if you use NetStandard dll installed via MSI package you should add necessary dependencies to work with netStandard version (please see release notes for more information).
