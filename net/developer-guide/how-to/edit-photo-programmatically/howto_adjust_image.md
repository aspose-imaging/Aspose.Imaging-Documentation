# How to adjust an image with Aspose.Imaging program library

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To adjust an image brightness use the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage/adjustbrightness/">AdjustBrightness method</a> and set a brightness parameter between -255 and 255 to perform corrections. The same you can do with <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage/adjustcontrast/">AdjustContrast method</a> to make contrast corrections with parameter settings to a range from -100 and 100. If the image has a color hue, you can make gamma corrections by setting the Red, Green and Blue components coefficient or a general gamma coefficient with <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage/adjustgamma/">AdjustGamma method</a>:
