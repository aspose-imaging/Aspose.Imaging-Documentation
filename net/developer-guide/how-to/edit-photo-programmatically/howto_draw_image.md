With Aspose.Imaging you can use several methods to draw graphics primitives such as
<a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawline/">DrawLine</a>, 
<a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawellipse">DrawEllipse</a>, 
<a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawrectangle">DrawRectangle</a>,
<a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawarc">DrawArc</a>, 
<a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawbezier">DrawBezier</a> and
<a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/drawstring">DrawString</a>. 
You need to create a graphic surface to draw an image from scratch and set up graphic properties. We will create a surface of 100 x 100 pixels with 32 bits per pixel in our example and set the background to yellow color with <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/drawing/net/system.drawing/graphics/clear/">Clear method</a>. Then we can define a drawing tool, for example, a Pen with a Blue color, to draw a dotted line or use SolidBrush for continuous lines with different colors, followed by X, Y coordinates of the start and end points of the lines:
