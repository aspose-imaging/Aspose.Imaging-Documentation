## **Dithering for Raster Images**
Dithering is a technique of creating the illusion of new colors and shades by varying the pattern of dots that actually create an image. It is the most common means of reducing the color range of images down to the 256 (or fewer) colors. Aspose.Imaging provides the dithering support for [RasterImage](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage) class by introducing [Dither](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage) method that accepts two parameters. First is of type DitheringMethod to be applied with two possible options FloydSteinbergDithering and ThresholdDithering. The second parameter to [Dither](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage) method is the BitCount in integer. BitCount defines the sampling size for the dithering result. Default value is 1 that represents black and white, whereas allowed values are 1, 4, 8 generating palettes with 2, 4 and 256 colors respectively.

## **Adjusting Brightness, Contrast and Gamma**
Color adjustments in digital images is one of the core features that most of the imaging libraries provide. Color adjustments can be categorized in the following.

1. **Brightness** refers to the lightness or darkness of color. Increasing the brightness of an image lights out all colors whereas decreasing the brightness darkens all colors.
1. **Contrast** refers to making the objects or details within an image more obvious. Increasing the contrast of an image increases the difference between light and dark areas so that the light areas becomes lighter and dark areas becomes darker. Decreasing the contrast will make lighter and darker areas stay approximately the same but the overall image becomes more homogeneous.
1. **Gamma** optimizes the contrast and brightness of the indirect lighting that is illuminating an object in the image.
### **Adjusting Brightness**
Aspose.Imaging for .NET API provide [Adjustbrightness](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage/methods/adjustbrightness) method for the [RasterImage](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage) class that can be used to adjust the **Brightness** by passing an integer value as parameter. Highest parameter value denotes to a brighter image. Here is the original image and the resultant image for comparison.

### **Adjusting Contrast**
The AdjustContrast method exposed by the [RasterImage](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage) class can be used to adjust the **Contrast** of an image by passing a float value as parameter.

{{< gist "aspose-imaging" "b93073a27bcdd4fefc2821e113f0cb3a" "Examples-CSharp-ModifyingAndConvertingImages-AdjustContrast-AdjustContrast.cs" >}}



Highest parameter value denotes to a higher contrast in the given image. Here is the original image and the resultant image for comparison.

### **Adjusting Gamma**
The AdjustGamma method exposed by the [RasterImage](https://apireference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage) class has two versions. One of the overloads accept one float value and performs the **Gamma** correction for red, blue & green channel coefficients. Whereas the other overload accepts three float parameters representing each color coefficient separately. The following code example demonstrates how to AdjustGamma on an image.

## **Blur an Image**
This article demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Imaging for .NET to perform Blur effect on an image. Aspose.Imaging APIs have exposed efficient & easy to use methods to achieve this goal. Aspose.Imaging for .NET has exposed the **GaussianBlurFilterOptions** class to create blur effect on the fly. **GaussianBlurFilterOptions** class need radius and sigma values to create blur effect on an image. The steps to perform Resize are as simple as below:

1. Load an image using the factory method Load exposed by Image class.
1. Convert the image into **RasterImage**.
1. Create an instance of **GaussianBlurFilterOptions** class with default constructor or provide radius and sigma values in the constructor.
1. Call the RasterImage.Filter method while specifying rectangle as image bounds and **GaussianBlurFilterOptions** class instance.
1. Save the results.

The following code example demonstrates how to create blur effect on an image.

## **Verify Image Transparency**
This article demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Imaging for .NET to check image transparency. The steps to check image transparency are as simple as below:

1. Load an image using the factory method Load exposed by Image class.
1. Check image opacity if opacity is zero image is transparent.
1. The following code example demonstrates how to check image is transparent or not.

## **Exporting Text as Shape While Converting EMF MetaFile**
Using Aspose.Imaging for .NET, developers can get text as shapes while converting EMF to SVG format. This topic explains in detail how to convert text into shape while converting EMF to SVG format. Aspose.Imaging for .NET provides the **TextAsShapes** property to get text as shape while converting EMF metafile. Below is the code demonstration of the said functionality.

## **Implement Lossy GIF Compressor**
Using Aspose.Imaging for .NET, developers can sets pixel difference. GIF's compression is based on a "dictionary" of strings of pixels seen. Normal encoder searches the dictionary for the longest string of pixels that exactly matches pixels in the image. Lossy encoder picks longest string of pixels that's "similar enough" to pixels in the image. Below is the code demonstration of the said functionality.
