Utilize the Image Converter license plugin to swiftly transform images from one file format to another, using our wide <a href="/imaging/net/supported-file-formats/">list of supported formats</a>. Before initiating the conversion process, ensure you apply for a Metered license by providing your public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method. Then, load your image file, such as in PNG format, using the `Load()` method, and proceed to save it in JPEG format using the `Save()` method along with the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging.imageoptions/jpegoptions/jpegoptions/">`JpegOptions()`</a> object parameter. Attempting to utilize an unlicensed feature of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark appearing on the resultant image.
