Leverage the Image Deskew license plugin to effortlessly correct skew in scanned documents or photos. You can apply the deskew operation to one of the <a href="/imaging/net/supported-file-formats/">supported image file formats</a>. Before commencing the process, ensure you obtain a Metered license by providing your public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method. Then, load your file, such as a TIFF image format, using the `Load()` method, and proceed to deskew using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage/normalizeangle/">NormalizeAngle()</a> method before saving it with the `Save()` method.
