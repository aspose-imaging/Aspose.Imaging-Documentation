Easily adjust image sizes while retaining control over resolution and quality with the Image Resizer license plugin. Before starting, ensure you acquire a Metered license by providing your public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method. Import your image in a compatible format from the <a href="/imaging/net/supported-file-formats/">list of supported formats</a>, then employ the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image/resize/">Resize()</a> method to modify the image dimensions according to your preferences. Finally, save the resized image. Remember that using an unlicensed feature of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark being applied to the output image.
