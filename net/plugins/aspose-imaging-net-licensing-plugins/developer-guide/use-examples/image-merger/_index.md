Utilize the Image Merger License plugin to effortlessly create photo collages by seamlessly combining images in various layouts, including horizontal, vertical, tiled, and customizable arrangements. Source image files in various formats from the <a href="/imaging/net/supported-file-formats/">list of supported image formats</a> to merge them seamlessly. Before applying the merge operation, ensure you acquire a Metered license by providing your public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method. In the C# code example below, we create a new `Image` object with a white background and dimensions equal to the total sum of source images. Then, place images in the specified directions using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/graphics/drawimage/">DrawImage()</a> method of the `Graphics` class and save the resulting image in the supported image format. Utilizing unlicensed features of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark appearing on the output image.
