## **Running on a Shared Server Environment**

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All Aspose .NET components are best operated with the Full Trust permission set. This is because Aspose .NET components sometimes require access to registry settings and files located outside of the virtual directory, such as for reading fonts. Additionally, Aspose .NET components rely on core .NET system classes, some of which also necessitate Full Trust permission to function properly in certain scenarios.

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from various companies often enforce a Medium Trust security level. With .NET 2.0, this security level may impose the following constraints that could impact the functionality:

- **RegistryPermission**: This permission is not available, preventing access to the registry, which is necessary for enumerating installed fonts when rendering documents.
- **FileIOPermission**: Access is restricted to files within your applicationâ€™s virtual directory hierarchy. This limitation may prevent fonts from being read during export.

For these aforementioned reasons, it is advisable for Aspose.Imaging to operate under Full Trust permissions. While some features of the library may still function in Medium trust for certain tasks, others may not (such as rendering), possibly due to calls to GDI+ image processing.

## **.NET Core DLLs installed via MSI package**

**Please note:** When using the NetStandard DLL installed via the MSI package, it's essential to include the necessary dependencies to ensure compatibility with the NetStandard version. For detailed instructions, please refer to the release notes for more information.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As Aspose.Imaging for .NET offers support for .NET Standard 2.0 (including .NET Core 2.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET 5) as well as .NET 6, it can be seamlessly utilized in Core Applications running on Linux-like operating systems. We are continually enhancing the .NET Core support in our API. However, to optimize the usage of features provided by Aspose.Imaging for .NET, we recommend that our customers perform the following operations:
</p>

Please install:

1. libgdiplus package
2. libc6-dev package
3. package with Microsoft compatible fonts: `ttf-mscorefonts-installer` 

```sh

```

4. package with other fonts:

```sh
apt-get update && apt-get install -y fontconfig fonts-wqy-zenhei
```

### **How to install libgdiplus package on Ubuntu Linux**

To install `libgdiplus` package you can follow the instructions:

```sh

### **Working with .NET7 dlls**

<p align='justify'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The .NET7 version of the Aspose.Imaging DLLs utilize an alternative graphics engine called <a href="https://products.aspose.com/drawing/ru/net/">Aspose.Drawing</a> instead of `System.Drawing.Common/GDI+`. This means users do not need to employ any additional graphics engine to utilize the library. However, to achieve optimal results while utilizing the features of Aspose.Imaging for .NET, we recommend our customers perform the following operations:
</p>

Please install:

1. Default fonts:

```sh
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install fonts-freefont-ttf
```

2. Microsoft fonts (if necessary):

```sh
sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
```

3. Other fonts: 

```sh
apt-get update && apt-get install -y fontconfig fonts-wqy-zenhei
```
