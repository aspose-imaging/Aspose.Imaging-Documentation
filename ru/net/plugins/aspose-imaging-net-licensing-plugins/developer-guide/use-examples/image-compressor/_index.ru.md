Use the capabilities of the Image Compressor license plugin to effortlessly optimize your image sizes across a diverse array of <a href="/imaging/ru/net/supported-file-formats/">supported formats</a>. To initiate compression, first secure a Metered license by applying your public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method. Compression options vary depending on the image format. Below, you'll find C# code snippets tailored for popular image formats. Whether you're compressing raster or vector images, you have a wide range of options at your disposal. Take, for instance, the WEBP format, where you can customize compression settings using <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/ru/net/aspose.imaging.imageoptions/webpoptions/">WebpOptions()</a>, toggling the Lossless parameter to false and setting the Quality parameter to 50%.
