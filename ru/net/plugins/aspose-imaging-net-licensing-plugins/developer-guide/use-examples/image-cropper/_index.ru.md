Effortlessly select desired fragments and crop images using the Image Cropper license plugin. Before beginning, secure a Metered license by providing your public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method. Load your image with file format from the <a href="/imaging/ru/net/supported-file-formats/">list of supported formats</a>, then apply the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/ru/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage/crop/">'Crop()'</a> method of the `RasterImage` class with the chosen rectangle area. Finally, save the resulting image. Utilizing an unlicensed feature of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark appearing on the output image.
