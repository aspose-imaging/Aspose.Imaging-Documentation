Utilize the Animation Maker Licensing Plugin to effortlessly create animations from your images. In the C# code example provided below, we begin by configuring the Metered license settings, unlocking the animation-making feature by providing the public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method. Please note that using unlicensed features of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark appearing on the output images. You can use your images to make animations from a variety of image files in different formats from the <a href="/imaging/ru/net/supported-file-formats/">list of supported image formats</a>, seamlessly adding them to the output file, such as an animated GIF format. You have complete control over animation parameters and can define the desired frame duration and overall duration. Loaded images can be seamlessly added to the animated GIF file using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/ru/net/aspose.imaging.fileformats.gif/gifimage/addpage/">GifImage.AppPage()</a> method before saving it to the output file.
