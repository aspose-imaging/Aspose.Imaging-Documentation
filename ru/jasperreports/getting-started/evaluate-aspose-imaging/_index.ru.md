You can easily download Aspose.Imaging for JasperReports for evaluation from the [download page](https://downloads.aspose.com/imaging/jasperreports). The evaluation download is same as the purchased download. The evaluation version simply becomes licensed after [applying a license](/imaging/jasperreports/licensing/).

{{% /alert %}}

Evaluation version of Aspose.Imaging for JasperReports (without a license specified) provides product functionality to some extent not complete though. One limitation is that it always injects the evaluation watermark on output files.
