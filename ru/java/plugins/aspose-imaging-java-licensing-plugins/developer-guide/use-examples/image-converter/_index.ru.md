Swiftly convert images from one file format to another using the Image Converter license plugin and our extensive <a href="/imaging/ru/java/supported-file-formats/">list of supported formats</a>. Before starting the conversion process, make sure to obtain a Metered license by providing your public and private keys through the `setMeteredKey()` method. Then, load your image file, such as in PNG format, using the `load()` method, and proceed to save it in JPEG format using the `save()` method along with the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/ru/java/com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions/jpegoptions/">JpegOptions()</a> object parameter. Failure to use a licensed feature of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark being added to the resulting image.
