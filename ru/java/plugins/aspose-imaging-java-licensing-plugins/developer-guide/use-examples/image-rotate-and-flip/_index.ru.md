Seamlessly adjust the orientation of a photo or image to a fixed or arbitrarily selected angle, with or without flipping, utilizing the capabilities of the Image Rotate and Flip License plugin. Before executing these transformations, it's crucial to obtain a Metered license by providing your public and private keys through the `setMeteredKey()` method. Import image files in various formats from the <a href="/imaging/ru/java/supported-file-formats/">supported list</a>, then apply the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/ru/java/com.aspose.imaging/rasterimage/#rotate-float-">rotate() method</a> to specify the desired angle or use the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/ru/java/com.aspose.imaging/image/#rotateFlip-int-">rotateFlip() method</a> to flip the image. Finally, save the edited image in the supported format. Please note that using unlicensed features of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark being applied to the output image.
