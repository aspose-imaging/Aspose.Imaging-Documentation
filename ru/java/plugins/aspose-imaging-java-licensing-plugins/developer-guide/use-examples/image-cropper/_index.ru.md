Select desired fragments and effortlessly crop images using the Image Cropper license plugin. Before you start, obtain a Metered license by providing your public and private keys using the `setMeteredKey()` method. Load your image with the <a href="/imaging/ru/java/supported-file-formats/">supported file formats</a>, then use the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/ru/java/com.aspose.imaging/rasterimage/#crop-com.aspose.imaging.Rectangle-">`crop()`</a> method of the `RasterImage` class with the selected rectangle area. Finally, save the cropped image. Failure to use a licensed feature of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark appearing on the output image.
