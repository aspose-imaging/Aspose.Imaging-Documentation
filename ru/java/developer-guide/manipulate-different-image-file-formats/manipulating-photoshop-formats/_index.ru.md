## **Exporting Image to PSD**
PSD, Photoshop document, is the default file format used by Adobe Photoshop for working with images. Aspose.Imaging lets you save files in PSD format so that they can be opened and edited in Photoshop. This article shows how to save a file to PSD with Aspose.Imaging, and it also discusses some of the settings that can be used when saving to this format.

PsdOptions class is a specialized class in the com.aspose.imaging.imageoptions package used to export images to PSD. In order to export and image format to PSD, first create an instance of the Image class, either loaded from an existing image file or created from scratch. This article explains how.

In the examples below, an existing image is loaded by passing the file path to the Image class' static load method. Once it is loaded, save the image using the Image class' save method, and supply a PsdOptions object as the second argument.

Several of the PsdOptions class' properties can be set for advanced conversion. Some of the properties are ColorMode, CompressionMethod and Version.

Aspose.Imaging for Java supports the following compression methods through the CompressionMethod enumeration:

- CompressionMethod.Raw
- CompressionMethod.RLE
- CompressionMethod.ZipWithoutProtection
- CompressionMethod.ZipWithProtection

The following color modes are supported through the ColorModes enumeration:

- ColorModes.Bitmap
- ColorModes.Grayscale
- ColorModes.RGB

Additional resources can be added, such as thumbnail resources for PSD v4.0, v5.0 and higher, or grid and guide resources for PSD v4.0 and higher.

The code below opens a BMP file from disk and saves it to PSD with RLE compression and RGB color mode.

## **Importing image to PSD layer**
This article demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Imaging for Java to add or import an image to a PSD layer. Aspose.Imaging API have exposed efficient & easy to use methods to achieve this goal.

Aspose.Imaging for Java has exposed the **DrawImage** method of the **Layer** class to add/import an image into a PSD file. **DrawImage** method needs location and image values to add/import an image into a PSD file.

The steps to import image into PSD layer are as simple as below:

1. Load a PSD file as an image using the factory method Load exposed by Image class.
1. Convert the image to **PsdImage**.
1. Create an instance of **Layer** class and assign the PSD image layer to it.
1. Load the image that is needed to be added.
1. Call the Layer.DrawImage method while specifying location and image instance.
1. Save the results.

The following code example demonstrates how to import an image.

## **Creating Thumbnails from PSD Files**
PSD is the native document format of Adobe's Photoshop application. Adobe Photoshop (version 5.0 and later) stores thumbnail information for preview display in an image resource block that consists of an initial 28-byte header, followed by a JFIF thumbnail in RGB (red, green, blue) order.

Aspose.Imaging for Java API provides an easy to use mechanism to access the resources of PSD file. These resources also include the thumbnail resource that in turn can be fetched and saved to disc as per application needs.

The following code snippet demonstrates the usage of Aspose.Imaging for Java API to achieve the same.

## **Creating Indexed PSD Files**
Aspose.Imaging for Java API can create Indexed PSD files from scratch. This article demonstrates the use of PsdOptions and PsdImage classes to create an Indexed PSD while drawing some shapes over the newly created canvas.

The following simple steps are required to create an Indexed PSD file.

1. Create an instance of PsdOptions and set it's source.
1. Set ColorMode property of the PsdOptions to ColorModes.Indexed.
1. Create a new palette of colors from RGB space and set it as Palette property of PsdOptions.
1. Set CompressionMethod property to required compression algorithm.
1. Create a new PSD image by calling the PsdImage.create method.
1. Draw graphics or perform other operations as per requirement.
1. Call PsdImage.save method to commit all changes.
