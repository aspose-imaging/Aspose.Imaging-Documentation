Effortlessly adjust the orientation of an image or photo to a fixed or custom angle, with or without flipping, using the Image Rotate and Flip License plugin. Before applying these operations, ensure you obtain a Metered license by providing your public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method. Load your image files in various formats from the <a href="/imaging/net/supported-file-formats/">list of supported image formats</a>, then utilize the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage/rotate/"> Rotate()</a> method to set the desired angle or the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/image/rotateflip/">RotateFlip()</a> method to flip the image, and save the modified image in the supported format. Please note that using unlicensed features of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark being applied to the output image.
