Unlock an extensive range of image and photo effects and apply various filters to enhance your images and adjust image parameters with the Image Effect Creator Licensing Plugin. With this license plugin, you can smooth images using filters such as GaussWiener, BilateralSmoothing, MotionWeiner, GaussianBlur, and MedianFilter. Additionally, you can adjust image brightness, contrast, and color gamma, as well as apply dithering, binarization, and grayscale effects. The C# example below demonstrates the application of popular filters and effects to images from the <a href="/imaging/net/supported-file-formats/">supported file formats list</a> using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/net/aspose.imaging/rasterimage/">RasterImage</a> class. Before applying the filters, ensure you obtain a Metered license by providing your public key and private password using the `SetMeteredKey()` method.
