Effortlessly craft photo collages using the Image Merger License plugin, seamlessly combining images in various layouts like horizontal, vertical, tiled, and customizable arrangements. Import image files in diverse formats from the <a href="/imaging/java/supported-file-formats/">supported lists</a> for seamless merging. Before executing the merge operation, obtain a Metered license by providing your public and private keys through the `setMeteredKey()` method. In the provided Java code example, a new `Image` object with a white background and dimensions equal to the total sum of source images is generated. Subsequently, images are positioned in specified directions using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/graphics/#drawImage-com.aspose.imaging.Image-com.aspose.imaging.RectangleF-">drawImage() method</a> of the `Graphics` class, and the resulting image is saved in the supported format. Failure to utilize licensed features of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will lead to a watermark appearing on the output image.
