The Photo Album Maker Licensing Plugin provides a convenient solution for merging your images or photos into practical multi-page albums. You can utilize various image files in different formats from the <a href="/imaging/java/supported-file-formats/">supported image formats list</a> to seamlessly combine them and create a single multi-page file, such as a PDF or TIFF format. Before creating a photo album, ensure you obtain a Metered license by providing your public and private keys using the `setMeteredKey()` method. In the provided Java code example, a new `tiffImage` object is created, and existing images are added using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.tiff/tiffimage/#addFrame-com.aspose.imaging.fileformats.tiff.TiffFrame-">addFrame() method</a>. To generate a multi-page TIFF file with your images on separate pages, you can utilize the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/image/#create-com.aspose.imaging.Image---">Image.create()</a> method by passing an array of images as a parameter. Afterward, you can save the output to the file using `TiffOptions()`. Please note that utilizing unlicensed features of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark appearing on the output image.
