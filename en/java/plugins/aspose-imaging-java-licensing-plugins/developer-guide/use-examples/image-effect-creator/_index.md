Utilize the Image Effect Creator Licensing Plugin to access a wide array of image enhancements and filters. With this plugin, you can smooth images using filters such as GaussianBlur, MedianFilter, BilateralSmoothing or MotionWeiner filter. Additionally, you have the ability to adjust image parameters like brightness, contrast, and color gamma, and apply effects such as dithering, binarization, and grayscale. The provided Java example showcases the application of these filters and effects to images from <a href="/imaging/java/supported-file-formats/">supported file formats list</a> using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/rasterimage/">RasterImage class</a>. Before using the filters, remember to obtain a Metered license by providing your public and private keys using the `setMeteredKey()` method.
