Effortlessly correct skew in scanned documents or photos using the Image Deskew license plugin. You can apply the deskew operation to one of the <a href="/imaging/java/supported-file-formats/">supported image file formats</a>. Before starting the process, make sure to obtain a Metered license by providing your public and private keys using the `setMeteredKey()` method. Then, load your file, such as a TIFF image format, using the `load()` method, and proceed to deskew using the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/rasterimage/#normalizeAngle--">`normalizeAngle()`</a> method before saving it with the `save()` method.
