Effortlessly resize images while maintaining control over resolution and quality with the Image Resizer license plugin. Before beginning, obtain a Metered license by providing your public and private keys using the `setMeteredKey()` method. Import your image in a compatible format from the <a href="/imaging/java/supported-file-formats/">list of supported file formats</a>, then utilize the <a href="https://reference.aspose.com/imaging/java/com.aspose.imaging/image/#resize-int-int-">resize() method</a> to adjust the image dimensions according to your preferences. Finally, save the resized image. Keep in mind that utilizing an unlicensed feature of the Aspose.Imaging graphic library will result in a watermark being applied to the output image.
